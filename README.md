# SproutCore Utils

### Description:

Some utility functions that are used by other packages in SproutCore 2.0.

### Problems:

If you run into a problem, please file an issue on this repository.

### Synopsis:

TODO: Upload documentation somewhere

For the time being, there are only a few functions and it should be easy to
grok their use from the source code.

### Requirements:

In order to use the Utils package, you'll need:

  * [SproutCore 2.0's runtime library](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore20)

### Install:

You can use the Utils package by either downloading the JavaScript files
provided in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore-utils/archives/master)
of this repository or using [BPM](http://getbpm.org/). To install it via BPM, simply run

    bpm add sproutcore-utils

And this will handle adding all of its dependencies as well. You, of course, need to
be using BPM for your application or package for this to work ;)
